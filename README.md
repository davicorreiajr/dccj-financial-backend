This is the backend of my a personal project, whose target is to create an app where the user controls his/her finances. It's a Ruby on Rails project, but works only as an API.

## Running

First, clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/davicorreiajr/dccj-financial-backend.git

```

And finally, start the server:
```
rails server
```

## Tests

```
